The brilliant colors and contrast of the scene make it appear surreal and otherworldly. But this is no roadside attraction. The only way to enjoy this sight is to work for it—namely, by making the 10-mile hike down into Havasu Canyon, a tributary of the Grand Canyon. But before you can make the hike, you have to obtain a permit from the Havasupai Tribe (not the national park). Due to the sensitive nature of the canyon, and the limited space in the canyon to accommodate visitors, permits are very, very limited—and dayhiking into the canyon is not permitted. Permit reservations become available on Feb. 1, with camping available from Feb. 1 through Nov. 30. Permits are $100–$125/night; all reservations are for three nights. If you’re fortunate enough to obtain a coveted Havasu Canyon permit, the journey starts with an 8-mile trek from Hualapai Hilltop down to Havasupai Village.",

On (well, in) the Edisto River is a series of secret treehouses, each with a comfortable sleeping area, stocked kitchen, futons, hammocks, camp chairs, fire pit and picnic table. To get to the treehouses, hop in a canoe or kayak and paddle to the start of your treebound adventure. You have to bring your own food and beverages, but the canoe ride and shuttle are included.",

After the drive, take the boardwalk through the wetlands, or hike the intimidating Hellbrook Trail. For the most daring campers, there’s also bouldering, cave exploring and ice climbing!",

Mount Rainier is hard to beat, but the old-growth forests, roaring waterfalls and fields of wildflowers come close. Yogerst suggests doing the 96-mile Wonderland Trail, which goes through the point that gives the park its name.",

The campsite doesn’t have any exciting bells and whistles, but the nearby lodge serves an upscale dinner if you need a break from camp life. Enjoy!",
